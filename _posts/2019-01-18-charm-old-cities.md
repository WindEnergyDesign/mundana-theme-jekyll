Starting in 2016, WE Design is a University of Manitoba, student-operated organization comprised of undergraduate and graduate students from mechanical, electrical, computer, and biosystems engineering. We aim to promote green energy, by providing an opportunity for our students to develop professional skills in the designing, manufacturing, and project management of our small-scale wind turbine.
